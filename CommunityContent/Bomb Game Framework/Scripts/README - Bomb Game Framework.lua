Bomb Game Framework
v1.0
by: standardcombo

Starting point for a first-person, DE-style game where one team plants the bomb and the other
team defends or diffuses the bomb. Includes many components such as basic inventory, shop,
ADS weapons and even persistent storage of money earned.

To use, start a blank project, delete everything from the hierarchy and drop the framework
template into the hierarchy.
